            The image tag is used to add images into the HTML page, the opening tag is written as &ltimg&gt but as opposite to most of the tags, there is no closing tag for the image tag.<br>

            But now as my knowledge and experience increased I now can add the pic.<br>
            
            <br>
            3-Pargraph tag "p":<br>
            The paragraph tag makes breaks between lines, the opening tag its written as &ltp&gt and the closing tag is written as &lt/p&gt.

      </div>
      <div>
        <b><h1>SPAN Vs. DIV Elements</h1></b>
          <p>
            Both those elements are used to add styles to the HTML page, are used in CSS alot. the one differentiator between them is the the span is an inline but the div is block element.<br>
            The span element is written as &ltspan class="info"&gt for the openeing tag and &lt/span&gt for the closing tag.<br>
            DIV example: <div>"text div"</div><br>
            And an example for the span: <span>"text spanned"</span>.
          </p>
      </div>
        Thanks alot!!
